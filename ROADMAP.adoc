* [ ] Production deployment guide
* [ ] Security audit

== Future Directions

=== Post-1.0 Possibilities

* **WebTransport support** - When Deno supports WebTransport
* **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** - Companion library for SSE
* **GraphQL subscriptions** - WebSocket transport for GraphQL
* **Cluster support** - Multi-process WebSocket handling
* **Metrics/observability** - OpenTelemetry integration
* **Protocol adapters** - Socket.IO, STOMP, MQTT compatibility

== Non-Goals

Things this library intentionally does not aim to provide:

* Full Socket.IO compatibility layer
* Built-in authentication (use your own middleware)
* Database-backed message persistence
* Horizontal scaling coordination (use Redis/NATS)
* Browser polyfills (standard WebSocket only)
